This project involves automating a Mixing Station using PLC ladder logic programming and an HMI-based control, aiming to automate the mixing process in industrial applications such as food processing, chemical blending, or liquid manufacturing.

The control logic was developed using GX Works3 software, which facilitated a ladder logic program to manage multiple operations, including:

- Sequential filling of materials
- Motorized mixing control
- Level sensor-based tank monitoring
- Timed operation of valves and stirrers
- Emergency stop

The HMI interface was designed using GT Designer3 software.
Key features included:

- Automatic/Manual mode
- Operator Level Security
- Real-time tank level monitoring
- Start/stop buttons for process control


This integration of PLC and HMI improved process accuracy, reduced manual intervention, and enhanced system safety and user-friendliness.
